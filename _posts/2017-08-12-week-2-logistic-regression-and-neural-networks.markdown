In this post, we will go over the basics of the functioning of a neural network. The idea will be to use Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent to illustrate the fundamentally important concepts of **forward propagation** and **backpropagation**. As an example, we might write some code for image recognition, which should give you an idea of just how powerful neural networks.

The post loosely follows (with some edits and additions by me) the lectures in Week 2 of the [Deep Learning Specialisation on coursera][deep-learning-coursera]
