Welcome to my Deep Learning Tutorial Series!

The idea to do this series came after I registed for the new [Deep Learning specialisation][deep-learning] on Coursera. It's taught by Andrew Ng, one of the most well-known names in Machine Learning.

This tutorial series is serving multiple purposes:

1. I understand better the material that is being taught
2. I have written notes for the specialisation
3. Maybe these notes will help someone else
4. I learn to draw Affinity Designer. It's what I'll be using to make the illustrations you see in the coming posts.
5. I learn to use the Jekll blogging platform, because why not?

I intend to use this post as a landing page for the tutorial series. I'll link to the individual posts from here.
