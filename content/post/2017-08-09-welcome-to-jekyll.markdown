Hi! I'm Pritam Sukumar, a freelance Software Engineer travelling around in India while working on pet projects and being a project reviewer for the Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree.

I've been programming since I was a kid, starting with learning C by myself (anyone use *Let us C* by Yashwant Kanetkar? One of the clearest books I've ever read) when I was 14, moving onto C++, then taking a diversion into MATLAB for my graduate work in Aerospace Engineering, and then jumping into Java and Android.

I want to use this space to keep notes on what I'm learning, and also maybe write tutorials once in a while if I can find the enthusiasm and put in the time. Right now, I'm learning:

1. Deep Learning from Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning ][deep-learning] course on Coursera
2. iOS from the [Stanford CS193p course][cs193p] on iTunes

So hopefully you'll see tutorials on all those things. Good luck!
Cheers,
Pritam
